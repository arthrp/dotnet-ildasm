# dotnet-ildasm
Partial fork of https://github.com/pjbgf/dotnet-ildasm (Making it standalone).

For those who prefer standalone tool to NuGets. Removed all target frameworks except .NET Core v2.

Just build it and run like ```dotnet dotnet-ildasm.dll <your assembly path> -t``` to print IL of your assembly.
